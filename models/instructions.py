emergency_instructions = {
    "Cardiac Arrest": " While waiting, immediately start performing CPR. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest and your other hand on top. Interlock your fingers and press down hard and fast, at least 2 inches deep, at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. If possible, have someone else take turns with you every 2 minutes to prevent fatigue. If an AED (Automated External Defibrillator) is available, turn it on and follow the prompts.",
    "Choking": " If the person is conscious and can’t cough or breathe, perform the Heimlich maneuver. Stand behind the person, place your arms around their waist, make a fist with one hand, and place it just above the person’s navel. Grasp your fist with the other hand and perform quick, upward thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.",
    "Severe Bleeding": " To control severe bleeding, immediately apply firm pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage. If the blood soaks through, add more cloth or bandages on top—do not remove the original bandage. Keep applying pressure, and if possible, elevate the injured limb above the level of the heart to slow the bleeding.",
    "Burns": "For burns, immediately cool the affected area under cool running water for at least 10 minutes. Do not use ice or very cold water, as this can damage the tissue further. After cooling, cover the burn with a non-stick sterile dressing or clean cloth.",
    "Seizure": "During a seizure, protect the person from injury by moving objects away and cushioning their head with something soft like a folded jacket. Do not restrain their movements or put anything in their mouth. Once the seizure stops, place the person in the recovery position by rolling them onto their side, with the head tilted slightly back.",
    "Stroke": " If you suspect someone is having a stroke, keep them calm and comfortable. Check their symptoms using the FAST method: Face—ask them to smile and check for drooping; Arms—ask them to raise both arms and see if one drifts downward; Speech—ask them to repeat a simple phrase and listen for slurred speech; Time—note the time symptoms began and call emergency services if you haven’t already.",
    "Allergic Reaction": " If the person is having a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), administer an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) if available. Inject it into the outer thigh, even through clothing if necessary. Hold the injector in place for 10 seconds after use.",
    "Fracture": " Keep the injured limb as still as possible. If you need to move the person or the limb, splint the fracture by placing a padded board or rolled-up cloth along the injured area and securing it with a bandage or cloth. Do not try to realign the bone.",
    "Poisoning": " If poisoning is suspected, try to identify the substance involved. If the person is conscious, ask what they have ingested and when. Do not induce vomiting unless directed by a medical professional. If the person is unconscious, place them in the recovery position.",
    "Heatstroke": " Move the person to a cooler environment immediately. Remove excess clothing and cool the person by spraying them with cold water, applying ice packs to the armpits, neck, and groin, or wrapping them in a cool, wet sheet.",
    "Drowning": " Remove the person from the water immediately. If they're not breathing, start CPR right away. Tilt their head back, lift the chin, pinch the nose, and give two rescue breaths. Then begin chest compressions. Continue CPR until the person starts breathing or help arrives.",
    "Hypothermia": " Move the person to a warm, dry place. Remove wet clothing and wrap them in warm blankets. If conscious, give them warm, sweet drinks (no alcohol). Do not rub their skin or apply direct heat. If unconscious, monitor breathing and perform CPR if necessary.",
    "Electric Shock": " Do not touch the person if they're still in contact with the electrical source. Turn off the power source if possible. Once it's safe, check for breathing and pulse. Begin CPR if necessary. Cover any burns with a sterile gauze bandage.",
    "Snake Bite": " Keep the person calm and still to slow the spread of venom. Remove any constricting items like jewelry. Clean the wound with soap and water. Do not attempt to suck out the venom or apply a tourniquet. Seek medical help immediately.",
    "Concussion": " If you suspect a concussion, keep the person awake and monitor them closely. Ask them simple questions to check their mental state. Do not allow them to sleep immediately after the injury. If they lose consciousness, vomit, or have a seizure, seek emergency medical care.",
    "Asthma Attack": "Help the person sit upright and encourage them to take slow, deep breaths. If they have an inhaler, assist them in using it. If symptoms do not improve within a few minutes, seek emergency medical help.",
    "Nosebleed": "Have the person sit up straight and lean forward slightly. Pinch the soft part of the nose and hold for 10-15 minutes. Avoid lying down or tilting the head back. If bleeding persists, seek medical attention.",
    "Fainting": "Lay the person flat on their back and elevate their legs to improve blood flow to the brain. Loosen any tight clothing and ensure they have fresh air. If they do not regain consciousness within a minute, seek medical help.",
    "Eye Injury": "Do not rub the eye. Rinse the eye with clean water or saline solution. If a foreign object is embedded, do not attempt to remove it. Cover the eye with a clean cloth and seek medical attention immediately.",
    "Animal Bite": "Wash the bite area thoroughly with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic ointment and cover with a clean bandage. Seek medical attention, especially if the bite is from a wild or unknown animal.",
    "Panic Attack": "Encourage the person to breathe slowly and deeply. Reassure them and help them find a quiet place to sit. Remind them that the attack will pass and stay with them until they feel better.",
    "Heat Exhaustion": "Move the person to a cool place and have them lie down with their legs elevated. Give them cool water to drink and apply cool, wet cloths to their skin. If symptoms worsen, seek medical help.",
    "Hypoglycemia": "If the person is conscious, give them a sugary drink or snack. Monitor their condition and if they do not improve within 15 minutes, seek medical help. If unconscious, do not give anything by mouth and seek emergency assistance.",
    "Frostbite": "Move the person to a warm place and remove any wet clothing. Warm the affected area using body heat or warm (not hot) water. Do not rub the area or use direct heat. Seek medical attention as soon as possible.",
    "Chemical Burn": "Remove any contaminated clothing and rinse the affected area with cool running water for at least 20 minutes. Avoid using strong jets of water. Cover the burn with a clean cloth and seek medical help.",
